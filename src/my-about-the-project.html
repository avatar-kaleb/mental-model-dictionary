        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <!-- Need avatar and name here!-->
          <p>Hello there and welcome! <br /><br />  I'm Kaleb, a young professional who has accepted my dual life between social millenial and nerdy software engineer. 
          I love playing sports, watching Marvel shows on Netflix, reading Fantasy novels in my spare time, meeting new people on random adventures, and learning new ways to grow throughout my
          journey to achievement. 
        </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy learning about mental models and as they turn you into a rational thinking machine!
        Interested in learning more about my journey?&nbsp<a href="https://kalebmckelvey.xyz">Check out my personal blog!</a>
        </p>
        <p>In my first POC with Polymer 2 I was able to get this site up and running quickly. I reused code from examples and utilized
          components for a quick "do something" type of start. Can't wait to dive more into ES6 and Polymer 2/3 as the WIP masterpiece continues!

        <h1>Why Create a Mental Model Dictionary?</h1>
        <h3>My Passion</h3>
        <p>
          Many mental models have been written and discovered by people worldwide, who like me are interested in becoming the best
          thinker they can. Currently, I find mental models in blog posts, videos, or other mediums that 
          each describe their version and understanding of the concepts - many with repeated content. I created a notebook in OneNote
          to better organize, but <strong>decided it was time to let others use those notes</strong> and modernize the approach.
        </p>
        <h3>PWA & Polymer 2 Investigation</h3>
        <p>
          At work I consistently work with the Polymer Components from the Predix Design System team
          to develop consistent UI design for our users. Currently these are built in Polymer 1,
          eventually being transitioned to Polymer 2/3. In order to prepare for the change,
          I decided to use Polymer 2 and develop the dictionary as a PWA to learn it now for the future.
        </p>

      <h1>Roadmap</h1>
      <p>I hope to gain feedback and request from users on the future of the project. Although this is my passion,
        and also a side project for an idea that would be helpful in my own life - I look forward to making 
        it useful for all!!
        </p>
        <p>Below are release updates. I will be creating a feedback form for the site soon, in the meantime please email me at <a href="mailto:kalebmckelvey3@gmail.com?Subject=Mental Model Dictionary Suggestion" target="_top">kalebmckelvey3@gmail.com</a> for suggestions.
